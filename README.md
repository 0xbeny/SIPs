# Snaps Specifaction & Improvement Proposals

## Purpose

Make Snaps into an open standard by using SIPs as a way to document specifications in implementable way.

Snaps in current state are being researched by Metamask, and work closely with multiple open standards to extend the state-of-the art. Such as [TC39 Realms](https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses) and [CASA](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA).
We envision the future of Snaps to be a way to run sandboxed Javascript in a secure way using permissions. Not only by blockchain wallets, but also in projects such as Node.js and Deno.

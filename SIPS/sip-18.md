## Abstract

This SIP exposes a few permissions to manage the networks including add a new chain to Metamask while installation of snap and removing that chain while unistanllation.

## Motivation

Since Metamask only supported a shortlisted networks, there are a lot of networks that are not included on that list. users have to add info (such as Network name, RPC URL, Chain ID,... ) manually. there is a potential to utlize a snap to make the life easier for those users. by applying this improvement, Metamask will get dynamic behaviour on networks list instead of add chain to static list which is hard-coded inside codebase.

## Specification

> Indented sections like this are considered non-normative.
